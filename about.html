      <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; font-family: Crete Round; font-style: italic;">Leveling the Playing Field</p>
      <p>Our organization aims to level the playing field for individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who aspire to pursue a medical career. Drawing from personal experiences of navigating the pre-medicine track without guidance, we strive to provide mentorship, resources, and support to prevent others from facing similar challenges.

    <section class="our-story">
      <h2 class="section-title">If I had had a mentor....</h2>
      <p>"My intention in creating this organization was to help those with lower socioeconomic status stand on the same level as those who have been blessed with connections and opportunities from the beginning. I don’t come from a family of doctors nor do I know anyone close to me that has walked my path before. If I had a mentor from the beginning of my journey on the pre-medicine track, I would’ve been on a different path. I essentially was lost for the first two years trying to navigate on my own. It has been very difficult for me to volunteer at clinics, shadow doctors, or even find a job that gives clinical experience. If I had someone in the system it would have been much easier. I want to prevent others from falling into the same mistakes as me. I want them to look up to someone who has been in their footsteps at one point in time so they know that their dream is achievable. Sometimes, you just need motivation from someone who you want to be like to push you towards your goal. This organization is for anyone and everyone interested in pursuing a medical career. Whether that entails you are still wondering if medicine is what you want to pursue or if you are looking for someone to guide you through the complexities of the medical field, we are here to support you every step of the way. Our commitment goes beyond just providing resources; we strive to cultivate a nurturing environment where individuals from all backgrounds can thrive and cultivate their full potential. Join us in building a community where everyone has a chance to pursue their dreams and make a meaningful impact in healthcare. Together, we can make a difference and ensure that no one feels lost or alone on their journey to becoming a healer."
