        <p>Our Mentorship Program bridges the gap between aspiration and achievement in medicine by pairing undergraduates with medical students who offer invaluable insights on application cycles, class selections, MCAT preparation, and more. We create connections based on shared study habits and personality types, ensuring relevant and effective mentorship for both traditional and non-traditional paths. Flexible communication options and personalized pairing preferences enhance the mentorship experience.

        <p>Matching undergraduates with medical students is a priceless opportunity to bridge the gap between aspiration and achievement in the field of medicine. Medical students, having traversed the rigorous journey of gaining admission to medical school, possess a wealth of firsthand knowledge and insights. They are best equipped to relay information on application cycles as the requirements are always changing every few generations. From advising on recommended class selections to the intricacies of medical school requirements, mapping out undergraduate pathways, offering strategic MCAT preparation tips, and sharing personal application experiences, medical students are uniquely positioned to provide mentorship and support at every crucial step of an undergraduate's journey towards a career in medicine. The undergraduates receive personalized guidance and encouragement, while medical students have the opportunity to pay it forward and foster the growth of future leaders in the medical field.

                <p>When pairing undergraduates with medical students, we aim to create meaningful connections based on shared interests, similar majors, characteristics, and pathways. Whether you're pursuing a traditional or non-traditional educational journey, we believe that finding common ground fosters effective mentorship and support. By aligning interests and academic backgrounds, we strive to facilitate relationships that are not only enriching but also tailored to meet the unique needs and aspirations of each individual. From orthodox students to non-traditional learners, everyone brings something valuable to the table, and our pairing process ensures that each mentee is matched with a mentor who can offer relevant guidance and insights. Together, we embrace diversity and inclusivity, recognizing that every journey toward a career in medicine is unique and deserving of support and encouragement.</p>          
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Here are the criteria we use to match students:</p>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-family: Crete Round;">Study Habits - studying tips are most effective when the two students closely aligned in how they like to study.</p>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-family: Crete Round;">Major/College - being able to give specific advice can be invaluable.</p>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-family: Crete Round;">Personality - we want to make sure we can pair two personalities that can get along.</p>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-family: Crete Round;">Special Interests - if two students have the same interests in specialties or topics, a stronger bond can be formed.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">What does Mentorship Look Like?</h2>
        <p>In our mentorship program, both mentors and mentees have the flexibility to choose the mode of communication that best suits their preferences and schedules. Whether it's in-person meetings, virtual sessions, a hybrid approach, or even communication through text or email platforms, we aim to accommodate everyone's needs and ensure effective engagement. Additionally, participants have the option to express preferences regarding the pairing process. Mentors and mentees can indicate if they're interested in being paired with someone from a specific medical school they aspire to attend or with someone who attended the same undergraduate institution. This personalized approach enhances the mentorship experience, fostering connections that are not only supportive but also meaningful and relevant to the goals and aspirations of each individual involved.
